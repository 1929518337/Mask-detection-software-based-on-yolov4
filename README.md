This software is aimed at detecting whether pedestrians are standardized to wear masks in specific scenes, using deep learning algorithms to achieve mask detection in pictures, videos, connected cameras, etc., in addition to support and visualization of the results. The mask detection system is based on machine vision deep learning technology, using YOLO trained mask detection model for detection, can realize unattended uninterrupted work, and the system can actively find the monitoring area is not wearing a mask situation, and in the most timely manner for the alarm, while minimizing the phenomenon of false alarms and missed alarms; greatly save personnel costs, improve work efficiency!
